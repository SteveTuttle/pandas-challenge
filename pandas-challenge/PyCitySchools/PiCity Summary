## PyCity Schools Analysis

As noted in the PyCity Schools Analysis, lager, district schools that had higher budgets were more likely to have lower test scores than smaller to medium schools with lower to more moderate spending budgets.The analysis also shows charter schools outperformed district schools in all metrics, as well as smaller/medium schools out performed larger schools. 

These metrics did not consider the ESL make-up within the schools, nor does it note socio-economic status of each neighborhood these schools are in. All of which do have impact on student performance.

It is worth mentioning that Reading Scores outperformed Math Scores district wide to varying degrees. This disparity increased with school size and total budget.
